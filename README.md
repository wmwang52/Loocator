## 📱 About

**Loocator** is an iOS app designed to help students discover, review, and locate the best bathrooms on campus. Inspired by my mentor’s original bathroom-finding app, Loocator expands on that idea with a modern, scalable solution. The app empowers users to:

- **Find** the nearest bathrooms using real-time location.
- **Review** and rate bathrooms for cleanliness, accessibility, and gender-neutral features.
- **Contribute** by adding new bathrooms and sharing details with the community.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Map:** Instantly see nearby restrooms based on your current location.
- **Bathroom Details:** View ratings and accessibility features before you go.

- **Easy Contributions:** Add new bathrooms in seconds—location auto-filled for you.
