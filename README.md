## Background

- Our team developed an iOS application called Loocator, inspired by my mentor's bathroom-finding app. This application aimed to expand my iOS Development skills and create a scalable application. The goal of Loocator was to assist students in finding, reviewing, and locating the best bathrooms on campus. The application serves as a rating system that allows students to rate the cleanliness, accessibility, and gender-neutral features of bathrooms. Additionally, the application tracks the user's location to show nearby restrooms on a map.


## Description

- Loocator consists of 4 main screens. The initial screen showcases nearby bathrooms based on the user's current location. Users can then select a bathroom to view its details, where they are presented with information such as accessibility features and cleanliness ratings. They can then upvote or downvote the bathroom based on their experience. Finally, users can add new bathrooms by clicking the "Add" button on the top right of the screen. Their location is automatically filled out, and they can add the necessary details to the bathroom.


## How to run

- To run the app, clone the repository and launch it within Xcode on an Apple computer.
